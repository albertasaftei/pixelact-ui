## MCP Server

Use the shadcn MCP server to browse, search, and install components from registries.
<br />
The shadcn MCP Server allows AI assistants to interact with items from registries. You can browse available components, search for specific ones, and install them directly into your project using natural language.
<br />
For example, you can ask an AI assistant to "Build a landing page using components from the acme registry" or "Find me a login form from the shadcn registry".
<br />
Registries are configured in your project's <code>components.json</code> file.
<br />
